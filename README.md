A Costume Rental shop maintains information about the various available costumes in a text file. This application will: - 
1. Read our data-storing text file and display all the available costumes for renting.
2. Customers can choose what item to rent or return a rented item.
3. A note/invoice should be generated for the particular client and written to a file (stock update in a text file).
